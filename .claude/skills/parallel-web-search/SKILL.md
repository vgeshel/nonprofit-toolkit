# Web Search

Search the web for: $ARGUMENTS

## Command

Choose a short, descriptive filename based on the query (e.g., `ai-chip-news`, `react-vs-vue`). Use lowercase with hyphens, no spaces.

```bash
parallel-cli search "$ARGUMENTS" -q "<keyword1>" -q "<keyword2>" --json --max-results 10 --excerpt-max-chars-total 27000 -o "/tmp/$FILENAME.json"
```

The first argument is the **objective** — a natural language description of what you're looking for. It replaces multiple keyword searches with a single call for broad or complex queries. Add `-q` flags for specific keyword queries to supplement the objective. The `-o` flag saves the full results to a JSON file for follow-up questions.

Options if needed:

- `--after-date YYYY-MM-DD` for time-sensitive queries
- `--include-domains domain1.com,domain2.com` to limit to specific sources

## Parsing results

Do not set `max_output_tokens` on the command execution — the output is already bounded by `--max-results` and `--excerpt-max-chars-total`. Capping output tokens will truncate the JSON and break parsing.

Parse the JSON from stdout. For each result, extract:

- title, url, publish_date
- Useful content from excerpts (skip navigation noise like menus, footers, "Skip to content")

## Response format

**CRITICAL: Every claim must have an inline citation.** Use markdown links like [Title](URL) pulling only from the JSON output. Never invent or guess URLs.

Synthesize a response that:

- Leads with the key answer/finding
- Includes specific facts, names, numbers, dates
- Cites every fact inline as [Source Title](url) — do not leave any claim uncited
- Organizes by theme if multiple topics

**End with a Sources section** listing every URL referenced:

```
Sources:
- [Source Title](https://example.com/article) (Feb 2026)
- [Another Source](https://example.com/other) (Jan 2026)
```

This Sources section is mandatory. Do not omit it.

After the Sources section, mention the output file path (`/tmp/$FILENAME.json`) so the user knows it's available for follow-up questions.

## Setup

If `parallel-cli` is not found, install and authenticate:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://parallel.ai/install.sh | bash
```

If unable to install that way, install via pipx instead:

```bash
pipx install "parallel-web-tools[cli]"
pipx ensurepath
```

Then authenticate:

```bash
parallel-cli login
```

Or set an API key: `export PARALLEL_API_KEY="your-key"`
